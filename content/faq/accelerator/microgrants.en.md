**Yes, it is possible!** The Garage FRI has access to funds (*thank you sponsors!*) which are indented for **you and your**
projects.

However such funds come with a "condition":

- after the completion of the project, the equipment will remain in the FRI Garage, where it will be available for other teams

This excludes if your project contains the given equipment, in this case an arrangement can be made.
