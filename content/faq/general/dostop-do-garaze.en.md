All students who are part of a FRI garage [program](/programs/) are entitled to the keys to access the FRI garage. Inside the FRI garage there is a lot of equipment, with more on the way, therefore when nobody is inside the FRI garage the facilities needs to be locked.

The protocol for acquiring a key:

1. Join one of the programs in the FRI garage
2. Your contact details will be forwarded to the FRI human resources office
3. Your new key will be available to you there

When you have your key, you can stay for as long as you wish except when the workspace is reserved - in this case you can still work in the conference room.
