The FRI garage is primarily intended:

- all students of University of Ljubljana
   - undergraduate
   - postgraduate
   - doctoral students

- employees of University of Ljubljana

Besides the ones mentioned above, mentors and lecturers or experts from the industry are also allowed.

The FRI garage is not a recreational area.

In certain cases you do not need a key, for example:

- you are participating in one of the free [workshops](/programs/workshops) (you need to sign up for the workshop)
- come to brainstorm as part of [Group brainstorming and BoF sessions](/programs/bof-meetings)
- other organized activities where the organizer opens the doors

For complete independent work you need a key, with which you can open/close the facilities.
