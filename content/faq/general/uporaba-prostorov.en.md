The FRI garage consists of two parts:

- the primary "*coworking* space (for approx. 15 people)
   - here is where workshops and all the other programs will be conducted
   - part of the room contains a small kitchen and couch
   - three tables (which are electronically adjustable - so you can work standing up)
- the secondary smaller room (for approx. 5 people)
   - ideal for meetings and conferences

Both rooms are available for **reservations**.
