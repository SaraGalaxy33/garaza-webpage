**Yes, this is possible!** FRI Garage has available funds (thanks to sponsors!), which are designed for you and your project.

But this financing has one "restriction":
- after finishing the project, this equipment remains in the FRI Garage and can be used by other teams

This does not apply if your project uses such funds as the prototype, in that case, we can come to an arrangement.
